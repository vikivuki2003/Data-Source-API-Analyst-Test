# Data Source API Analyst Test

## Purpose

This repository is created as part of the assignment for the Data Source API Analyst role. The objective is to demonstrate my understanding of APIs, data extraction requirements, and troubleshooting approaches by working with the GitHub API.

## Repository Structure

- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the repository and outlines the purpose of each section. It also includes a brief documentation of the approach taken to complete the assignment.
  
- **/Content**: This folder contains files related to:
  - **API Documentation**: A detailed overview of the GitHub API endpoints used in this assignment, including their functionalities and usage.
  - **Python Code**: Scripts for the authentication process, data extraction, error handling, rate limiting, and pagination. This code is designed to facilitate interaction with the GitHub API.
  - **Troubleshooting Guides**: Documentation outlining common issues encountered during API requests and their solutions, as well as approaches to data cleaning.

- **/Postman_Collection**: This folder includes a Postman collection or a Jupyter notebook used in Google Colab for testing the API. It contains organized requests for each endpoint that will be tested.

## Approach

1. **Research GitHub API**: 
   - Identified necessary endpoints to meet client needs, such as searching for repositories, retrieving commits, and accessing repository contents.
   - Studied the API documentation to understand request logic, pagination, rate limits, and error handling mechanisms.

2. **Set Up a GitHub Repository**: 
   - Created this repository to organize the files and documentation related to the assignment.

3. **API Extraction**: 
   - Utilized Postman and Google Colab to send requests to the GitHub API.
   - Defined environment variables in Postman to streamline requests and wrote Python functions in Colab to handle authentication, rate limits, and pagination.

4. **Troubleshooting**: 
   - Documented common issues and their solutions, including handling authentication errors and rate limits.

5. **Results**: 
   - Exported the Postman collection and saved the Google Colab notebook to this repository for review.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my ability to work with APIs, extract data, and troubleshoot common issues. I look forward to receiving feedback on my work.
